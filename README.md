# Color Flash - a KTANEModKit module

![Color Flash Module](https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-colourflash/Manual/img/Component.png "Color Flash Module")

Color Flash is an experimental module leveraging the newly-exposed [KTANEModKit](https://github.com/keeptalkinggame/ktanemodkit) for _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_. It exploits the psychological effect known as the Stroop effect by prompting the defuser with a sequence of color words, but not necessarily in the color that the word indicates.

## The Manual

Visit https://ashbash1987.github.io/ktanemod-colorflash/Manual for a KTANE-like manual specifically for this module.

## Steam Workshop Installation

If you purchased _Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes_ through Steam, you'll be able to subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop.

Firstly, ensure that you are on the modpreview Beta of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes; to do this, in Steam, right click on the game and go to Properties, then go to the Betas tab, and in the drop-down, select __modpreview__. If all went well, you should be updating to the preview version, and once downloaded, the game's name should now have __[modpreview]__ on the end of it.

Next, join the KTANEMod Beta community group on Steam by going to http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ktanemodbeta

Finally, goto http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720338853 to subscribe to the Color Flash mod. This will download the module automatically for you, and will continue to download updates for the module when updates are released.

## Non-Steam Installation

If you didn't purchase 'Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes' through Steam, but you have a modpreview version to play on, then you can manually install the module instead of using the Steam Workshop.

Goto https://github.com/ashbash1987/ktanemod-colorflash/releases and download the latest release for the module.

Inside the *.zip file will be a folder called ColorFlash; drop that folder into the `<path>/<to>/Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes/mods` folder. (If the folder doesn't exist, create one for it).
